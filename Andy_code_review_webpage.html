  <h2>A little bit about me:</h2>
    <p>I am recently retired and starting to explore new interests - like coding.
    The first half of my career I was a planner, working on land use, natural resources
  and parks and recreation.  The second half of my career I worked at a Port Authority
doing master plans, project management, and asset management.  I have been married 33 years
to a wonderful woman named Diane who also recently retired.  While we each have our own
interests, we very much enjoy travel, kayaking, and family gatherings.  Our finest achievement
as a couple is our daughter, Emily, who works at at Epicodus.  She is a brilliant young woman
and without her help in the classroom before this assignment, I doubt I would have been able
to complete it.

Here are some of my personal interests:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Kayaking</li>
  <li>Playing guitar in a band</li>
  <li>Woodworking</li>
  <li>Cycling</li>
  <li>Archery</li>
  <li>photography</li>

</ul>
